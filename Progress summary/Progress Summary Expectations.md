#  Progress Summary Expectations

1. I want an update on your progress with the data you were given

To do this, you are to provide:
- a detailed description of the data
- all algorithms you have used on the data, and any analysis done on the derived models
- all algorithms you plan to use on the data, and the reason why you chose them

2. I want a description of the general problem statement

This should include:
- the purpose of the experiments in point 1
- the kinds of evaluation and analyses that will be performed on any generated model
- how that evaluation will help with the general problem

3. I want a schedule for your visits to IHPC

- I expect you to visit IHPC daily starting next week
- You will provide me with specific details on excuses for any days you aren't visiting - the excuses must be valid
- You will summarise the work you have done on a daily basis, and also update your schedule
- You are expected to spend all your free mornings+afternoons there and on occasion, evenings (to complete scheduled work)

4. I want an overall schedule of your deliverables based on SSEF submission requires (i.e., parts of the report to be complete), hypotheses, research questions, etc.

This should be a document you update frequently (at least daily) that helps explain what you believe your overall progress with the project is, and thus, how much more you have to do.

5. you will also summarise every meeting you have with Mr Venugopalan and Dr Harish.

I expect a detailed, with all relevant updates to the above based in these as well
