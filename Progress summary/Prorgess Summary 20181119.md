#Prorgess Summary 2018/11/19

## What's New

For the past week, I have

* Trained a Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (MLPClassifier) but obtain a model similar to linear model till now
* Stop to do the training and turn to read reports and complete a skeleton of my report.

## Plan to do this week

* Complete SSEF forms (as much as possible)

* Write a research plan for my SSEF
* Add regularization part in my rf model (Finish by tonight hopefully)
* Complete the introduction of my report (Finish by the weekend)
* IF STILL HAVE TIME: Build one or two more models (shouldn't take over one night..) Plan to be a regression model as so far all my models go under the classification models.

## Schedules of visits to IHPC

As I have written in my plan, there are a few things to settle down.

* Complete SSEF forms —— There are some sections that require project supervisors to complete
* Research plan —— I'm not quite sure about the rules of writing the research plan, like how long it should be and how specific it should go into. will ask in WhatsApp later..
* Review of introduction —— not quite sure when I can complete it though, probably during weekend (cough cough)

So I probably visit IHPC some time between Wednesday and Friday, so far I haven't received any commitments during these three days, so any time should be fine.
