# Progress Summary 2018/11/12

**What's New:**

- I've built a model based on multiple layer perception classifier and train the data with the dataset given (from 2015/01/01 to 2016/01/01)
- and obtain a very poor(?) result the highest mape obtained is only around 50 or rediculously high (like 300+) and when I run the model I've built in the past like the svm and random forest the results are similarly very poor
- Now I'm trying to find the problem.. (I've reinstalled the system ovee the weekend but I don't think it should affect the model..)

**Plan to do for this week**

* I've cleared most commitments during the past weekend.. though still some left but shouldn't take too much time
* Try to find the reason behind the declined performance of the model..
* Tune the parameter to find a model with better performance
* Edit the abstract and settle down a temporary "final" version
* Build a regression model 
* Do a systematic assessment and comparison between all the models built so far

**Scheduel for visits to IHPC**

After my school term is completely over, my CCA resumes so I'm not free after 4pm on Monday. Also the NOI sessions have been moved to morning so I can come on afternoons. So in all, I'm free every afternoon from tomorrow(Tuesday) onwards and we can meet any time.

So I'm thinking **can we meet on tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon, 3 or 4pm to discuss about the abstract?** Also reminder for the big dataset, though currently I do not badly need it yet.
