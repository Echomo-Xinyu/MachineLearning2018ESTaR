# Progress Summary 20181028

### Summary of last meeting

* Further tasks depend on the features of the data we currently have —— so plot trend predicted by the svm model and we cannot decide what to do next unless see the trend
* Acknowledge of the ssef deadlines

### Update on progress with the data given

###### What's New

_To reduce the length of long message, I'll just include what is new._

I've drawn the trend for each month, svg attached in the email. The score of the svm model is 84.2

And I complete the random forest implementation, getting a score of 87 (I don't quite remember but should be very close to this) and use randomisedSearchCV to find the optimal but rather same as what I have got in the first place (hmmmmm)

###### Plan to do

Continue to work on another model like a hybrid one? unless further task is given. If so, then proceed to complete tasks from mentors.

### Schedule for visits to IHPC

For the upcoming week, my class is going to end late on Monday, noi session on Tuesday and probably class outing on Thursday/Friday. So is going to be 

*Monday:* 2:45 - 7 pm

*Wednesday - Friday:* 2:15pm - 7pm *I'll make the update later

### Plan for next meeting

* Obtain necessary signature and begin to confirm project abstract and research plan (Hmm this reminds me of some unpleasant things)
* Discuss the next task and furture direction
