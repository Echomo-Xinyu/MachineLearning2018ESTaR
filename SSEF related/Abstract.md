# Abstract

Given the increasing use of solar energy, the prediction of the clean energy is becoming more significant over the time. We can derive solar radiation forecast from numerical weather prediction models (NWP) and in this case, clear-sky ratio (CSR), which reflects the ratio relationship between Diffuse SolarRadiation (SWDIF) and Direct Solar Radiation (SWDIR), is employed to classify the solar power potential into ten even coutinuous groups between 0 and 1. However, despite its high accuracy, NWP can only obtain stable future solar radiation prediction in six days and would be no longer accurate after 14 days. Moreover, NWP is not easy to run for non technical users. In order to get the long-term results quick, Machine Learning Algorithms, which can obtain long-term general trends, is now playing an important role in the area. In this paper, a few machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) together with the time series modes are going to be compared regarding their performance in prediction. Moreover, various feature selections including Linear Correlation and ReliefFalgorithm are used in this study.
