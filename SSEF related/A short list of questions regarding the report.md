# A short list of questions regarding the report

1.  When introducing different algorithms, I referred to many different websites and tried to find a satisfying one, which can be rephrased by me if I need to present. and some parts it is very similar to the official scikit website (which I refer to) 
    1.  is it fine or I need to rephrase the whole thing? (As I'm worried that after rephrasing the words may not be as accurate as before)
    2.  For the formulas, is there a need to modify the variable names in ordern to avoid the exact same formula?
2.  The length of the report should be within 7 pages and my report is slightly less than full 7 pages, so it's fine to add some extra small things. Is there any suggestion for the structural change?
3.  I've removed a lot from the "data-preprocessing" part I've written before and is the current version acceptable or needs to be further shortened?
4.  Is there anything to add on for the conclusion and evaluation?
